##	What is JNDI?

-	It stands for Java Naming and Directory Interface
-	JNDI in layman's terms is basically an Interface for being able to get instances of internal/External resources such as
	
	-	javax.sql.DataSource, 
	-	javax.jms.Connection-Factory,
	-	javax.jms.QueueConnectionFactory,
	-	javax.jms.TopicConnectionFactory,
	-	javax.mail.Session, java.net.URL,
	-	javax.resource.cci.ConnectionFactory,
	
-	jndiContext.lookup("java:comp/env/persistence/customerDB");
-	It comes standard with J2EE


##	What is its basic use?


-	JNDI allows distributed applications to look up for services in an abstract, resource-independent way
-	With this API, we can access many types of data, like objects, devices, files of naming and directory services
-	Eg. it is used by EJB to find remote objects
-	JNDI is designed to provide a common interface to access existing services like DNS, NDS, LDAP, CORBA and RMI

##	When is it used?

-	The most common use case is to set up a database connection pool on a Java EE application server. 
-	Any application that's deployed on that server can gain access to the connections they need using the JNDI name java:comp/env/FooBarPool without having to know the details about the connection.

	-	This has several advantages:

		-	If we have a deployment sequence where apps move from devl->int->test->prod environments, we can use the same JNDI name in each environment and hide the actual database being used. 
			-	Applications don't have to change as they migrate between environments.
		-	We can minimize the number of folks who need to know the credentials for accessing a production database. 
		-	Only the Java EE app server needs to know if you use JNDI
