#	What is the Purpose of JNDI


-	JNDI is the Java Naming and Directory Interface
- 	It's used to separate the concerns of the application developer and the application deployer


## Use case

-	When we writing an application which relies on a database, we shouldn't need to worry about the user name or password for connecting to that database
- 	JNDI allows the developer to give a name to a database, and rely on the deployer to map that name to an actual instance of the database
-	For example, if are writing code that runs in a Java EE container, we can write this to get hold of the data source with JNDI name "Database":


			DataSource dataSource = null;
			try
			{
				Context context = new InitialContext();
				dataSource = (DataSource) context.lookup("Database");
			}
			catch (NamingException e)
			{
				// Couldn't find the data source: give up
			}

-	Note there's nothing here about the database driver, or the user name, or the password. That is configured inside the container
-	JNDI is not restricted to databases (JDBC); all sorts of services can be given names



##	Lookup with properties


-	JNDI allows the simplification of a resource construct into just a name
	
			Properties prop = new Properties();
			prop.load(new FileInputStream(new File("FILE_NAME")));
			
			Context context = new InitialContext();
			DataSource dataSource = (DataSource)context.lookUp("java:/comp/datasource");
