#	Tomcat DataSource JNDI Example in Java


-	Actual benefit of DataSource comes when we use it with a JNDI Context.
- 	For example, connection pool in a web application deployed in a servlet container. 
-	Most of the popular servlet containers provide built-in support for DataSource through Resource configuration and JNDI context.
- 	This helps us in creating and using DataSource connection pool with just few lines of configuration


##	Apache Tomcat provide three ways to configure DataSource in JNDI context


-	Application context.xml:

	-	This is the easiest way to configure DataSource, all we need is a context.xml file in META-INF directory.
	-	We have to define Resource element in the context file and container will take care of loading and configuring it
	
		-	Since the context file is bundled with the WAR file, we need to build and deploy new WAR for every small configuration change. 
			-	Same issue comes if your application works in distributed environment or your application needs to be deployed in different testing environments such as QA, IT, PROD etc.
		-	The datasource is created by container for the application usage only, so it can’t be used globally
			-	We can’t share the datasource across multiple applications
		-	If there is a global datasource (server.xml) defined with same name, the application datasource is ignored


-	Server context.xml:	

	-	If there are multiple applications in the server and you want to share DataSource across them, we can define that in the server context.xml file. 
	-	This file is located in apache-tomcat/conf directory
	-	The scope of server context.xml file is application:
		-	So if we define a DataSource connection pool of 100 connections and there are 20 applications 
		-	Then the datasource will be created for each of the application
	-	This will result in 2000 connections that will obviously consume all the database server resources and hurt application performance
	
-	server.xml and context.xml

	-	We can define DataSource at global level by defining them in the server.xml GlobalNamingResources element
	-	If we use this approach, then we need to define a ResourceLink from context.xml file of server or application specific
	-	This is the preferred way when you are looking to share a common resource pool across multiple applications running on the server
	
##	Tomcat DataSource JNDI Configuration Example:

###	server.xml:

-	Add below code in the tomcat server.xml file.
- 	The code should be added in the GlobalNamingResources element.
- 	Also make sure that database driver is present in the tomcat lib directory, so in this case mysql jdbc jar have to be present in the tomcat lib


			
			<Resource name="jdbc/MyDB" 
				  global="jdbc/MyDB" 
				  auth="Container" 
				  type="javax.sql.DataSource" 
				  driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver" 
				  url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/UserDB" 
				  username="pankaj" 
				  password="pankaj123" 
				  
				  maxActive="100" 
				  maxIdle="20" 
				  minIdle="5" 
				  maxWait="10000"/>

-	Here we are creating JNDI context with name as jdbc/MyDB which is a type of DataSource
- 	We are passing database configurations in url, username, password and driverClassName attribute
- 	Connection pooling properties are defined in maxActive, maxIdle and minIdle attributes

### context.xml

-	Add below code in the server context.xml file.

		<ResourceLink name="jdbc/MyLocalDB"
                global="jdbc/MyDB"
                auth="Container"
                type="javax.sql.DataSource" />


###	Tomcat DataSource JNDI Example

-	JNDI Looking up inside servlet container

				@WebServlet("/JDBCDataSourceExample")
				public class JDBCDataSourceExample extends HttpServlet {
					private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
					   
					protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
						Context ctx = null;
						Connection con = null;
						Statement stmt = null;
						ResultSet rs = null;
						try{
							ctx = new InitialContext();
							DataSource ds = (DataSource) ctx.lookup("java:/comp/env/jdbc/MyLocalDB");
							
							con = ds.getConnection();
							stmt = con.createStatement();
							
							rs = stmt.executeQuery("select empid, name from Employee");
							
						}
					}	
	
-	Look up samples
	
			ctx = new InitialContext();
			DataSource ds = (DataSource) ctx.lookup("java:/comp/env/jdbc/MyLocalDB");
			
			
			
			
			ctx = new InitialContext();
			Context initCtx  = (Context) ctx.lookup("java:/comp/env");
			DataSource ds = (DataSource) initCtx.lookup("jdbc/MyLocalDB");
			
			
## 	Switching to other database server

-	We can easily switch the database server because we are using Tomcat DataSource.			
-	All you need is to change the Database properties
-	So if we have to switch to Oracle database, our Resource configuration will look like below:

		
					<Resource name="jdbc/MyDB" 
						  global="jdbc/MyDB" 
						  auth="Container" 
						  type="javax.sql.DataSource" 
						  driverClassName="oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver" 
						  url="jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:orcl" 
						  username="hr" 
						  password="oracle" 
						  
						  maxActive="100" 
						  maxIdle="20" 
						  minIdle="5" 
						  maxWait="10000"/>
