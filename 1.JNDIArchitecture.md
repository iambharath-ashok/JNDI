#	JNDI

-	JNDI is the acronym of Java Naming and  Directory Interface
-	JNDI is  a Java API which well be used  by Java applications to find objects or data  with a specific name
-	JNDI supports  variety of naming and directory services


##	JNDI Architecture

-	JNDI has an API and an SPI(Service Provider Interface).  
-	The API enables the Java applications  to access the naming and directory services
- 	The SPI enables to plug in various naming and directory services. 
-	The Java applications can use these services using the API
-	This concept is explained below as a schematic

##	Overview to Naming Service

-	A naming service maps developer friendly names to objects
-	So that the applications can access the same object with the bound name
-	The javax.naming package contains the classes and interfaces  for accessing naming services
-	Naming service maintains a set of bindings
-	Bindings relate names to objects.
- 	All objects in a naming system are named in the same way (that is, they subscribe to the same naming convention)
- 	Clients use the naming service to locate objects by name


###	Names: 
	
-	To do the  look up , one must know the name of object. 
-	The syntax of naming is determined by the naming service.
-	It is known as the naming convention 

###	Bindings 

â€“ 	The association between a name and an object is referred as binding 
-	If  an application need to access an object using a name then the object should bound to the name before


###	Context 

-	A context is a set of name to object bindings
- 	The context provides the way to lookup the bindings
- 	It also provides options to bind ,unbind and rebind objects


###	InitilalContext 

-	It is the starting point of all naming and directory operations


###	Exceptions 

-	JNDI defines a hierarchy of Exceptions 
- 	The super class is NamingExceptions
- 	All other exceptions are deriving from NamingException

------------------------------------------------------------

##	Overview to DirectoryService

-	Similar to naming service here also it is possible to access objects with its name
- 	In addition to this , it is possible to get the attributes of objects
-	Also it is possible to search for objects with attributes


###	Directory and Directory Service

-	A directory is a connected set of  directory objects
-	A directory service is a service  which provides options for creating , adding ,removing and modifying attributes  associated with directory
-	There are many Directory service implementation available now a days
-	Examples are DNS(Domain Name System) and LDAP(Light weight Directory Access Protocol)

------------------------------------------------------------

##	Context and InitialContext

-	Context :
	-	The Context interface plays a central role in JNDI
	-	A context represents a set of bindings 
	-	A Context object provides the methods for binding names to objects and unbinding names from objects, for renaming objects, and for listing the bindings
	
	-	Context's methods:
	
		-	void bind(String stringName, Object object): Binds a name to an object. The name must not be bound to another object. All intermediate contexts must already exist.
		-	void rebind(String stringName, Object object): Binds a name to an object. All intermediate contexts must already exist.
		-	Object lookup(String stringName): Returns the specified object.
		-	void unbind(String stringName): Unbinds the specified object.

	-	The Context interface also provides methods for renaming and listing bindings:
	
		-	void rename(String stringOldName, String stringNewName): Changes the name to which an object is bound.
		-	NamingEnumeration listBindings(String stringName): Returns an enumeration containing the names bound to the specified context, along with the objects and the class names of the objects bound to them.
		-	NamingEnumeration list(String stringName): Returns an enumeration containing the names bound to the specified context, along with the class names of the objects bound to them.
				
-	InitialContext :

	-	InitialContext is a starting point in JNDI
	-	This class is instantiated with properties
